1.indian coin problem-
 sort in descending order , and try to take as much u can of any type

2.Activity selection problem - sort in increasing finish time,,,then take those whose start time is 
greater than or equal to previous.

3. Fractional Knapsack greedy algorithm - (approach) value/weight {value of item and its
 weight is given, you are thief}

4. Optimal pattern Merge greedy algorithm- Given N files with their computation time in array
you have to pick 2 files and add them do this until you get single file in array,,,
we need to reduce computation time(to solve use minheap)
Approach - take two smallest element and add them and then push its sum to minheap


5.Expedi greedy algorithm-( Problem) cow are driving truck,,,,fuel loss = 1L/km...
given - distance of fuel station from current position,,, and max fuel it can provide
also truck fuel tank capacity= infinite... distance of city from current position =L
(approach) = sort distance of fuel station from current pos in ascending order
then if tank =empty take fule else push to maxHeap 


6.max and min difference greedy algorithm- no need to do
